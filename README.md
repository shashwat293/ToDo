Todo List Application
Overview
This Todo List application is a simple and intuitive tool for managing tasks. It allows users to create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application also includes a search functionality to filter tasks based on their titles. The tasks are displayed in an expandable list format, showing details such as a description and the timestamp of the last update. The application uses a dummy JSON file as the data repository and supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved performance.

System Design
Architecture
The application follows a modular component-based architecture using React. The main components include:

CreateTask: Allows users to add new tasks.
Task: Displays individual tasks with options to edit, delete, and mark as completed.
TaskList: Renders a list of tasks.
SearchBar: Provides a search input to filter tasks.
Data Flow
State Management: The application uses React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management and lifecycle handling.
Data Storage: Tasks are initially loaded from a dummy JSON file (tasks.json). In a real-world scenario, this could be replaced with an API call to a backend service.
Routing and URL Handling: The application uses next/router for Next.js projects or react-router-dom for React projects to handle routing and URL parameters for search functionality.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
In Next.js, SSR is implemented using getServerSideProps, which fetches the initial tasks data on the server side before rendering the page. This improves performance and SEO.

Implementation
Key Features
Create Task: Users can add new tasks by providing a title and description.
Update Task: Users can edit existing tasks.
Mark as Done: Users can mark tasks as completed.
Search Tasks: Users can search tasks by title using the search bar. The search term is reflected in the URL parameters.
Expandable List: Tasks can be expanded to show additional details like description and timestamp.
Components
CreateTask: Contains a form for adding new tasks.
Task: Displays task details and provides actions like edit, delete, and toggle completion.
TaskList: Maps through the list of tasks and renders each task using the Task component.
SearchBar: Handles search input and updates the URL with the search term.
Styles
The application uses CSS modules for component-scoped styling, ensuring styles do not clash between components.
